In the summer before I started university, I got a bit lazy and wanted to make pool-cleaning a bit easier and more fun. So, I found some scrap materials to build a sleigh-like frame, cut some pool noodles, repurposed a rather hefty DC motor from a printer and voil√†.

I quickly wrote some bluetooth code and all of a sudden, I had a wide smartphone-operated boat.

And after stretching some screen across a light frame, I had a detacheable pool skimmer for the boat.

All in all, a very simple, yet time-saving build.

*It's winter at the time of writing, I'll try to upload a video here next season.*
