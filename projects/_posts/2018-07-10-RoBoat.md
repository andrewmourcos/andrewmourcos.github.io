In the summer before I started university, I got a bit lazy and wanted to make pool-cleaning a bit easier and more fun. So, I put together some scrap materials to build a sleigh-like frame, cut some pool noodles, repurposed a rather hefty DC motor from a printer and voil√†.

*Here it is driving without the skimmer attached -- It uses bluetooth to communicate with my phone*

For the skimmer portion, I stretched some screen across a light wooden frame:

*The skimming net that clips onto the front of the boat*

It simply attaches to the front of the robot with binder clips for easy detaching.

Unfortunately, the screen I used was finely meshed and dipped too low in the water so it makes the boat unbearably slow. I have managed to jankily attach a real pool skimmer to the front, but it isn't as nice as a detachable one. In the future I'll likely buy a proper net that I can fit to my frame.

Oh and here's an animation of the mechanical assembly I did to practice my CAD skills:
