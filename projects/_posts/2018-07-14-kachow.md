For my team's second year participating in the International Autonomous Robot Racing Challenge, we decided to challenge ourselves by using new technologies.

While we would normally use a single-board computer or even a laptop as the main processor for this task, we opted to use a smartphone instead. A smartphone has everything we needed: a camera (for CV), inertial sensors and GPS (for localization). 

We had to create an android application (my very first!) that ran an image processing algorithm, and communicated over BLE to a microcontroller. 

The main algorithm was written in C++ and uses a Java Native Interface (JNI) to interface with Android. Since a smartphone isn't very powerful, we really had to optimize the algorithm, making tradeoffs between robustness and speed.

I also got to experiment with PCB design. We used a CAD software to create a design which we etched ourselves onto a copper board.

Here was our comedic trailer video:

As you saw above, the car does a pretty good job at detecting the lines. However, it did have some difficulties with staying within them (sometimes steering too hard or too little). In future projects, I would like to address this by implementing a PID control system.
