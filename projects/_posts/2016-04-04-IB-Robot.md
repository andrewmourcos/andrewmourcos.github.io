In grade 10, I was in my final year of the IB Middle Years Programme. This meant that I was required to complete the "Personal Project": a research report relating to an important societal factor (safety, health, economy, etc.), that I would submit as my culminating, year-long project. 

This was around the time where self-driving cars became a very hot topic with Google, Tesla, etc. I was quite fascinated with the idea and for that reason, I chose for my project to be about the *Innovation and Moral Limits of Autonomous Cars*. I really loved learning about this topic so I spent a ton of time reading about it. In fact, I even arranged a skype call with a CS major to learn more about how they are using computer vision to provide autonomy (on a basic level).

My curiosity on the subject led to me writing a fantastic report and I even decided to make my own autonomous car prototype. The product was a shoebox-sized self-driving robot that uses 10 ultrasonic sensors in order to avoid obstacles while driving or to parallel park.

Through the research and practical components of my project, I was able to learn a lot about the future of autonomous vehicles, electronics, microcontroller programming and a small glimpse at the subject of computer vision. I even got the opportunity to present my product to students at my school for exposition day.

In fact, it seemed that my project gained a lot of popularity as I later won a prize for *scientific and technological innovation* at the gala. 

My advice for students working on their own personal project: choose something that you are interested in, you will be much more passionate in your work and it really shows.
