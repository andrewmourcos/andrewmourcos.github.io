Cruisin is my attempt at creating a custom Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). I was all too excited by the recent advances in autonomous driving and couldn't help but start a hands-on project. It is still under development, but this post shows the alpha version.

The above video is a behind-the-scenes look at the visual odometry (mapping) feature. The red dots are _features_ that my algorithm extracts and tracks their pixel coordinates across the frames. The pixel trajectories are shown in green.

# Facts about Cruisin
1. **It is a Multi-threaded system** : Cruisin is meant to run in real-time at the edge. It needs to be fast and effective at using the available resources (use all the cores!)
2. **Reverse Engineering CAN packets can be tough** : All modern cars have a diagnostic port (OBD2) which exposes the CAN bus (and a few others) where the computer units communicate. To read things like the speed (as I did), you have to manually track down the ID of the computer unit responsible and target specific unknown bytes in the data packet.
3. **It _is_ a bit worse in the rain** : The same route was attempted on a rainy day. It performed reasonably given the conditions, but will need a software component to filter out overly-reflective surfaces and ignore the windshield wipers.

# How I'm getting data from the CAN bus
All cars have a diagnostics port. They expose the CAN-High and CAN-Low lines that the ECUs use to communicate information such as speed, RPM, etc. I had to do a good amount of googling and reverse engineering to decipher the frame ID that corresponded to the useful telemetry sensors. For V1, I spliced an OBD2 cable, found the CAN-H/CAN-L wires and passed them through a CAN-to-USB device to the computer running Cruisin.
