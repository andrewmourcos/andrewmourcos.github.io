*First land-tests: mimicry of thuniform swimming patterns*


After securing funding through the Engineer of the Future fund, I founded LamperLabs with 4 colleagues to design a biomimetic robot platform that supports marine ecology research. If this piques your interest, feel free to reach out!

R&D efforts are underway, so expect updates and make sure to watch <a href="https://lamperlabs.github.io/">https://lamperlabs.github.io/</a>.
