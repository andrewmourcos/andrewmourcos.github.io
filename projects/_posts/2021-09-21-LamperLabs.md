Formed a team with some university friends to design a robotic fish prototype supported by the Engineer of the Future fund. A custom cable-drawn mechanism allows for accurate mimicry of thunniform swimming patterns, as well as achieve high mechanical efficiency by using a single continuously-rotating motor (as opposed to direction-switching actuators).
