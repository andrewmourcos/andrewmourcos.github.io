Wearable technology has become increasingly popular in recent years, and with good reason. These devices allow us to track our health, stay connected with our loved ones, and even control our smartphones without ever taking them out of our pockets. As part of my engineering capstone project, I had the opportunity to design a wearable device that combines all of these features into one sleek smart ring called <a href="https://ringify.github.io/">Ringify</a>.

In addition to health tracking, Ringify also includes a touch input that allows users to control various actions on their smartphones. With a simple tap or swipe of the finger, users can send automated texts, or even control their music without ever having to take their phone out of their pocket. This feature is particularly useful for those who are constantly on the go and need to stay connected throughout the day.

My responsibility was to lead our hardware and firmware design. To this end, I designed the 4 custom PCBAs, consisting of a battery management unit, a processor tile, a sensor tile, and the touch pad. The ring features a BLE SoC with a 32-bit ARM processor to collect health tracking and touch input data to forward to the user's smartphone.

Overall, Ringify represents the culmination of months of hard-work, research, and experimentation. It's a device that packs a lot of features in a sleek functional design. I'm definitely proud of what we were able to accomplish and look forward to cutting down on board size in future iterations now that the prototype has been tested.
