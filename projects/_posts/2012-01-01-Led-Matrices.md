This was one of my first big arduino projects. The first version I built was in 2012 (grade 7) with a friend of mine. I'm showing it here since it was such a big project for me in terms of learning experiences.

*The second version (7x10)*

First of all, it taught me important concepts in digital electronics. Namely, transistors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing">multiplexing</a> and common integrated circuits that I used in V1 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_(digital)">decade counters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register">shift registers</a>).

Second of all, it helped me get into programming at a young age. I spent so much time trying to debug the scrolling text code, but it definitely paid off! By the end, I had mastered 2d arrays :) . By the way, I have some code available <a href="https://github.com/andrewmourcos/LEDMatrixLibrary">here</a> on my GitHub.

Third of all, I got a lot of practice in soldering — you have no idea.

*Out of their casing — some questionable soldering at first, but I eventually got really good!*

In sum, this was definitely a game-changing project for me. It took me a while to build it the first time, but it opened so many doors to explore in my future projects. Also, I want to mention that I still have one of these sitting on my desk whenever I'm working.
