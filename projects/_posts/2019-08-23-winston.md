*The opening page of our android application, featuring Winston*

After our co-op term, my colleagues <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/yipeng-penny-ji">Penny Ji</a> and <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/robert-toyonaga-421176149">Robert Toyonaga</a> wanted to participate in another hackathon. Our first hackathon together was a great experience (Enghacks 2019), so I was all for it! Within a few days, we signed up for HackThe6ix (Toronto's biggest hackathon).

On the bus ride to Toronto, we brainstormed some ideas until we came up with a rough plan. We landed on the idea of helping drivers to follow the correct procedures after a car accident, while also facilitating the insurance claim process.

We started by doing some research. We talked to some of our contacts and even some representatives from Intact (a Canadian insurance company). Their insight helped immensely and allowed us to focus our solution to be most relevant.

Since smartphones are so ubiquitous nowadays, it made most sense to have our product as a smartphone application. We got to work and built our proof of concept as an Android app. It had two main functionalities:

- procedure walkthrough
- automatic damage classification

## Procedure walkthrough
After you get in a car-crash, there is a pretty straightforward list of things you need to do. However, driver's will often forget in the heat of the moment. Our app provides drivers with clear instructions on what they have to do.

We consulted official provincial guides to construct the walkthrough which would prompt the driver to complete a set of checkpoints (ex: make sure everyone is safe, move a safe distance away, etc).

## Damage Classification
Once it is safe to do so, our app will instruct the user to point their phone camera at the scene of the accident. By scanning the car, our system would tally all the damages which could further go into a damage report. The idea is that this report, along with the car model information could give the insurance companies and the driver a quick estimate of the cost.

To make this feature a reality, we used transfer learning and trained a tensorflow model on thousands of collision images scraped from the internet. What's even cooler is that our model is doing inference locally on the smartphone with tensorflow lite. In other words, you don't need internet and you don't need to communicate with a server to perform this classification.

## Ending Thoughts
It was definitely a great idea for us to participate in this hackathon. We built something awesome, got to meet some nice people and learned a bunch of new things. I can't wait for our next project!
