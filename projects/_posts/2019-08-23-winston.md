After our co-op term, my colleagues <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/yipeng-penny-ji">Penny Ji</a> and <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/robert-toyonaga-421176149">Robert Toyonaga</a> wanted to participate in another hackathon. Our first hackathon together was a great experience (Enghacks 2019), so I was all for it! Within a few days, we signed up for HackThe6ix (Toronto's biggest hackathon).

On the bus ride to Toronto, we brainstormed some ideas until we came up with a rough plan. We landed on the idea of helping drivers to follow the correct procedures after a car accident, while also facilitating the insurance claim process.

We started by doing some research. We talked to some of our contacts and even some representatives from Intact (a Canadian insurance company). Their insight helped immensely and allowed us to focus our solution to be most relevant.

Since smartphones are so ubiquitous nowadays, it made most sense to have our product as a smartphone application. We got to work and built our proof of concept as an Android app. It had two main functionalities:

- procedure walkthrough
- automatic damage classification

## Procedure walkthrough
After you get in a car-crash, there is a pretty straightforward list of things you need to do. However, driver's will often forget in the heat of the moment. Our app provides drivers with clear instructions on what they have to do.

We consulted official provincial guides to construct the walkthrough which would prompt the driver to complete a set of checkpoints (ex: make sure everyone is safe, move a safe distance away, etc).

## Damage Classification
Once it's safe to do so, our app instructs the user to scan the scene with their phone's camera. Using machine learning and some tricks, we're able to construct a damage report. The idea is that this report, along with the car model information, could give insurance companies and the driver a quick estimate of the cost.

To make this feature a reality, we trained a neural net classifier on thousands of images scraped from the web and deployed it with tensorflow lite. What's even cooler is that our model does inference locally! In other words, the it's light enough to run directly on the phone, with no need for internet/server access.

## Ending Thoughts
It was definitely a great idea for us to participate in this hackathon. We built something awesome, got to meet some nice people and learned a bunch of new things. I can't wait for our next project!
