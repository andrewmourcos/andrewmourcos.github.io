*Final design render*

Course-project/competition to design a system that retrieves a figurine while minimizing mission-time and weight. Our solution was the lightest (under 140g) and quite fast - using the circuit board as a chassis and using a disposable adhesive cartridge to collect the payload. Uses color sensors for line following and detection of drop-off zones. Uses a differential drive.
