*A 3d printer built from recycled parts (before I made the electronics permanent)*

I had an old broken printer at home that was collecting dust, so I decided to take it apart. From it, I salvaged a few parts (notably stepper motors) and I thought of a neat project idea: making a CNC machine (more of a 2d plotter). So, I made a frame and a pulley system from parts I had laying around and with a few tricks, I created a 2d plotter. Of course, it wasn't the most sturdy or precise system, but I still found it amusing as it was essentially made from garbage. 

Then, I got better idea: let's make it a 3d printer! Note that a 3d printer works pretty much the same as a CNC machine, but with a third axis that places layers of filament. To make this a reality, I needed some better components, so I upgraded the motors with surplus store stepper motors. Next, after adding a third axis, I needed to mount an apparatus that could extrude filament. I wanted to continue the trend of being resourceful, so I got a 3d printing pen *toy* and tampered with it such that it could be controlled by an arduino.

In the end, I had a functional 3d printer. Additionally, I gained more experience in CAD (creating simple designs to plot/print), CNC machines (g_code, etc.), electronics (designing a motor control circuit, power, etc.). 

However, my biggest takeaway was that I learned about the importance of modularity. Believe me when I tell you, this project required many reiterations.

Here is a video of the 3d printer in action:
