I had an old printer that had been sitting on a shelf, collecting dust, so I decided to open it up. I salvaged a few parts from it; notably the stepper motors with their gears and belts. So, I decided to use these to make a CNC machine. There were 2 main tasks for this project: creating a circuit that could execute g-code (used by CNC machines) and building a frame for the axis'. After completing both of these, I mounted a pen to my creation and let it run. At that point, I had a functional drawing CNC machine. Next, I created a z-axis for the machine and mounted a 3d printing pen toy to it. A few modifications and I had a rudimentary 3d printer!

Since then, I've upgraded the motors & pulleys and created a new circuit board.
