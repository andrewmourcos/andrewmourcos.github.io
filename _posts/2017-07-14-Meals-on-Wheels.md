My highschool had not had a proper robotics team for over 6 years, so in my junior year, I decided to found *Cavalier Robotics* to share my passion with other students. After hearing about the International Autonomous Robot Racing Challenge (IARRC) -- a university-level robotics competition -- I couldn't help but be interested in competing.

I gathered up a team and got to work!

By the end of the school year, we were able to build this robot which uses a single-board computer as the 'brain', a mono-camera setup as the 'eyes' and a MCU as the 'legs'. We also created a trailer video and an engineering report, as per the competition requirements.

Our whole team benefitted immensely from the experience: we learned about IEEE conventions, computer vision (my favorite part!), hardware, electronics, how to get funding, etc.

In the end, our car and algorithm worked great, as we won 2nd place as the only highschool team participating that year. 

We loved the project so much that we did it again the following year, but with a completely different approach (check it out in my projects section).
