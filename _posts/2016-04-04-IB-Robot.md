As part of the IB Middle Years Programme, I was given the task of working on a research report relating to an important societal factor (safety, health, economy, etc.), that I would submit as my culminating, year-long project. This was around the time where Google and Tesla were often in the media, talking about self-driving cars. Since I was very interested in this topic, I chose for my personal project to be about the innovation and moral limits of autonomous cars. I did lots of research, had a skype call with a professional and produced a great report. However, I went beyond this by experimenting with my own autonomous system.

The product was a small self-driving car that utilizes 10 ultrasonic sensors in order to avoid obstacles while driving and could even parallel park. 

Through the research and practical components of my project, I was able to learn a lot about electronics, microcontroller programming and even an introduction to computer vision (which I further pursued in later projects).

At my school, it seemed that my project gained a lot of popularity as I later won a prize for *scientific and technological innovation* at the gala. 

Moral of the story: work on things that you are passionate about.
