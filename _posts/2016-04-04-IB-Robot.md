In grade 10, I was given the task of working on a "personal project" for the IB program. This was a year-long culminating project where I got to choose to work on anything that I wanted. At the time, I was very interested in futuristic inventions and was enamoured by the idea of self-driving cars. For the project, I presented a 15 page report on the topic of autonomous cars and road safety and as a display for my presentation, I decided to make an attempt at creating an autonomous system. 

I made a chassis with tank steering and mounted 10 ultrasonic sensors to cover the periphery of the robot. These in turn, were connected to a microcontroller that I programmed to receive distance measurements from the sensors, then execute a driving decision. It had 2 modes: self-driving (through obstacles courses) and self-parking (parallel).

After attracting a lot of attention at the project fair, I won a prize at my school's gala for "scientific and technological innovation".
