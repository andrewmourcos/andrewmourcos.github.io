For my second year participating in the International Autonomous Robot Racing Challenge, I decided to challenge myself to use new techniques. 

While I would normally choose to use a single-board computer as the main processor for this task, I opted to use a smartphone instead. A smartphone has everything we needed: a camera (for CV), inertial sensors and GPS (for localization). 

I had to create an android application (my very first!) that ran an image processing algorithm, and communicated over BLE to a microcontroller. 

The main algorithm was written in C++, then ported it over to the app using android's NDK. Since a smartphone isn't very powerful, I really had to optimize the algorithm, making tradeoffs between robustness and speed.

Another thing that I got to experiment with is PCB design. The design was made using CAD software and we later etched it onto a copper board and soldered components to the SMD pads.
