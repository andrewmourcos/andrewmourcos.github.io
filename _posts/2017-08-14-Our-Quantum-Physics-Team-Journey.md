Sadly, I haven't had a lot of time to post on my blog recently, so I’m uploading this like two months after the activity (sorry ;) ). Nevertheless, lets talk about our Quantum Physics team’s victory!

Paul Mckarris founded the team in October and it initially consisted of his friends in grade 12. My older sister joined the team and she told me that I should join since I’m “really into Neil Degrasse documentaries and stuff…”. I thought it was a neat club and I also wanted to get to know the 12th graders since I was in a grade 12 Calculus class with them, so I joined! I told the teacher (Mr. Denis “Crazy-Frog” Jacques) that I was interested and he told me to watch a video about CERN’s Beamline for Schools Competition (BL4S) and to come to the next meeting. I went to the next meeting and we discussed a bit more about how the beamline and the competition works.

**HOW THE COMPETITION WORKS SUMMED UP**: Teams from around the world think of an experiment to conduct in a particle accelerator at CERN, then write a written proposal and make a short video to explain the experiment idea.

At the beginning of the project we were told to do some research and to think of experiment ideas. Some people suggested some experiments, but nothing stuck. I wanted to do something on the ‘Relativistic side’, Paul wanted to do something on the ‘Antimatter side’ and other people had different ideas, however we couldn’t find any applicable case for the accelerator. The grade 12’s were busy applying to universities, preparing for exams and suffering from mild senioritis. I was also super busy, trying to keep my robotics team intact, starting a squash team and studying for exams. Needless to say, it was EXTRAORDINARILY difficult to get the ball rolling.

During Christmas break, Paul got in contact with a professor from Alberta (prof. James Pinfold) who agreed to mentor us in our project. He helped us to decide on our project idea and most importantly, helped us to find a way to set it up in an accelerator!

** HOW OUR EXPERIMENT WORKS (SIMPLY)**: We blast a proton (hydrogen ion) at a target which makes it shatter into smaller sub-particles. We filter these sub-particles with our set-up, then measure their CHARGE. Up until now, physicists have only been able to see charges of +/-1. Our experiment aims to see particles with fractional charge (ex: +1/3) using a liquid scintillator (we later changed our scintillator to a solid one).

The rest of the project was more autonomous on our part: we got together to film and to write the report. I was in charge of directing the video portion of the project and I think it was a great success! We even got compliments on our video from Michael Roney, a VERY prominent figure in the physics world! In addition, after we won, a member of CERN contacted us and told us that our report was well done and it was the first time he’s read a report that included a projects limits (most teams shoot for the moon and don’t place restrictions). In the meantime we also had to think of a team name and we ended up picking the one that I suggested (WOOHOO!): Charging Cavaliers. Soon after we won, this name became a name to remember. News stations came to interview us. Articles flooded in. We even got the chance to meet some very important people (the minister of scientific research!!!! etc.)
